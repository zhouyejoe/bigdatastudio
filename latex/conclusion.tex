We build a memory monitor system, Memmetric, for Hadoop 1.2.1 based on Ganglia 3.6.0, which provides users with both real-time and historical monitoring on memory usages to find implicit memory bugs in their Hadoop jobs and to revise their Hadoop cluster parameter settings, instead of merely modifying the codes.

Besides, we also found that Ganglia is not suitable for task level monitoring perfectly.
