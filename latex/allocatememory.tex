In this sector, we modified the settings for the maximum running map/reduce tasks in one slave machine, which is called "map/reduce slot number". We set both the value for map and reduce to 8, and makes the threshold for 300MB. As in our test cluster, each slave machine has only 2GB physical memory, the experiment shows the result how hadoop acts in this case. Note that we also modified the JVM Xmx value to 700MB which avoids the memory failure caused by JVM that has been tested in section 4.2.3.
