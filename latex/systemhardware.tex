We deploy our system Memmetric to a cluster of three t2.small EC2 instances on Amazon Web Service (AWS), which are named as "hadooptest1", "hadooptest2" and "hadooptest3" to denote their IP addresses.
The instance "hadooptest2" is selected as the master of the cluster and the other two are datanodes.
For the purpose of configuring the parameters of Hadoop, we modify the "mapred-site.xml" file on each of these three nodes.
