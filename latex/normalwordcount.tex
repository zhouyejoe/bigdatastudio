First we run a normal wordcount job on the cluster and use Memmetric to monitor it. In this wordcount job, no memory is used for storage therefore a presumable result would be a straight line close to the x-axis in the real-time monitor. However, the running result is shown in Fig. \ref{ref:baseline.png}.
